Qiskit Fall Fest 2022 at University of Santiago de Compostela (USC)

## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for University of Santiago de Compostela (USC). We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the [Instituto Galego de Fisica de Altas Enerxias (IGFAE)](https://igfae.usc.es/igfae/).

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here on USC is going to be a workshop + quantum challenge, starting on October 21st, Friday, 2022. Details about the event and rules can be found below. The deadline for registration is October 20th, at 3pm CET. We are looking forward to seeing you at the event!
