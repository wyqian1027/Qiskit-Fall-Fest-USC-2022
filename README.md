# Qiskit-Fall-Fest-USC-2022 
Qiskit Fall Fest 2022 at University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), A Coruña, Spain (October 21st, Friday, 2022)

## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest 2022 event page for University of Santiago de Compostela (USC). We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted at the [Instituto Galego de Fisica de Altas Enerxias (IGFAE)](https://igfae.usc.es/igfae/), Aula B.

The Fall Fest at USC this year is going to be a **in-person workshops + quantum challenge** format, starting on October 21st, Friday, 2022. Details about the event and rules can be found below. The deadline for registration is October 20th, at 12pm CET. We are looking forward to seeing you at the event!

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest/) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local community’s skill set.

## Workshop Lecture Details
- The lectures will be given by quantum computing experts at IGFAE.
- This year's lectures will consist of two parts, and will cover introduction to quantum computing, quantum computing basics, quantum algorithm, and experimenting with Qiskit (open-source quantum ecosystem).
- [Lecture A: Introduction to quantum computing basics](https://github.com/wyqian1027/Qiskit-Fall-Fest-USC-2022/blob/main/lectures/Qiskit%20Fall%20Fest%20Workshop%20and%20Lecture%20by%20WQ%20v2.1.pdf) (English) [[YouTube video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZgrTQtiMcU)
- [Lecture B: Introduction to quantum teleportation and beyond](https://github.com/wyqian1027/Qiskit-Fall-Fest-USC-2022/blob/main/lectures/Qiskit%20Fall%20Fest%20Lecture%20Entanglement%20and%20Teleportation%20JSS.ipynb) (Spanish) [[YouTube video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4aaXg_4wzc)

## Quantum Challenge Details 
- You will be doing problem solvings on 3-4 quantum challenge problems, related to the workshop lectures, with help from mentors. 
- Top 5 scores of the challenge will be given special prizes provided by IBM Quantum team (fall fest-themed Qiskit swag pack, including a hat, art supplies, and more). 
- A personal computer is required to join the challenge.
- It is advised to install related environment and packages before the quantum challenge (See [Instruction](https://github.com/wyqian1027/Qiskit-Fall-Fest-USC-2022/blob/main/challenges/README.md) here). You are welcome to ask mentor for help on installation during the challenge if you have any trouble.
- There will be more seats and space in Aula C in case needed.

### Congratulations to the Top 5 challenge winners!!!
